# Face_Recognition_Attendance_System
  Stand-alone application which marks attendance using face recognition made by using python and it's different libraries using real time face recognition is designed to collect and manage studentâ€™s attendance records by taking pictures from camera devices installed in a class room. Based on the verification of students facial identification in the cameras, attendance will be updated in data base.


## Requirements & Libraries
* Desktop development with C++
* cmake
* dlib
* face_recognition
* numpy
* opencv-python
* tkinter
* sqlite3
  
## Detection & Recognition
  Although many face recognition algorithms have been developed over the years, their speed and accuracy balance has not been optimal. But some recent advancements have shown promise. A good example is Facebook, where they are able to tag you and your friends with just a few images of training and with accuracy as high as 98%. So how does this work? Today we will try to replicate similar results using a face recognition library developed by Adam Geitgey.
